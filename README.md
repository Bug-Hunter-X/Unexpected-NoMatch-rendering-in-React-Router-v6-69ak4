# React Router v6 - Unexpected NoMatch Component Rendering

This repository demonstrates an issue where the NoMatch component in React Router v6 unexpectedly renders even when a path matches an existing route.  The issue is subtle and might occur due to a mismatch between the expected URL and the actual URL in the browser.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe that the NoMatch component renders even when navigating to `/` or `/about`.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the URL in the browser and the URLs in the `Route` paths match exactly.  In this particular case, the issue was solved by carefully reviewing the URL structure and making sure there are no trailing slashes, unnecessary parameters, or other discrepancies.
